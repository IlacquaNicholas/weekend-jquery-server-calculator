# Server Calculator
### Duration
-this took 16 hours to complete

### Description
- What problem did you solve?
 *The problem was to take two numbers and be able to add, subtract, multiply or divid them. Then have that math problem show up once hti the equals sign. Also, once the clear button is clicked it would clear out the the numbers enetered. 

 -How did you solve it?
  * This was solved by using a server and client side.I have a project plan down below. I added to it once I was done. Still learning how to come up with a plan and adding to it to stay on track and not get lost in whats going on. 


### Project plan
1. Get the server up and running. 
2. Set up app.post and app.get in server. (basics)
3. set up HTML. 
4. Start with the Ajax and the input fields and displaying them on the DOM. 
5. Get the Addition button working first. 
6. Come up with a function on the server side to help configure the math being sent over from the client side. 
7. Once that works figure out how to get the answer to display on the DOM.
